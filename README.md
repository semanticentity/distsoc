# Distsoc Playground

A minimal, interactive playground for exploring CLIs and APIs visually.

- Open `distoc.html` in your browser.
- Use the terminal and interact with nodes.

**License:** Proprietary. All rights reserved.
- See the `gemma3_api_server.py` example for a Python backend that exposes available tools and runs them on demand.
- You can fetch tool lists and send commands from the UI using JavaScript `fetch` calls.

## Customization

- **Add new tools/nodes** by editing the backend or providing a JSON/YAML config.
- **Change the world** by modifying `distoc.html`â€”add new buildings, pets, or visual effects.
- **Wire up new commands** in the terminal to backend endpoints or in-game actions.

## Vision

Distsoc aims to make technical concepts accessible and fun for everyone. It can be used for:
- Teaching CLI and API basics to beginners
- Prototyping interactive tech demos
- Gamifying onboarding for developer tools
- Creative coding and learning experiments
